OAuth Authorization URL

Required body fields:
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "code": "code-from-github",
  "redirect_uri": "your-callback-url"
}
Set headers:

Generate a Private Key (üîê)
Found under: ‚ÄúGenerate a private key‚Äù section.

Use in: If you plan to access GitHub as the app itself (e.g., app installations), not just user-auth.

Needed for JWT creation to get installation tokens, which are independent of user OAuth tokens.

Not needed if you're doing only user OAuth.

| Key                      | Use                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `Client ID`              | Build auth URL and token exchange       |
| `Client Secret`          | Secure backend to get token             |
| `Callback URL`           | Redirection after user authorizes       |
| `Private Key` (optional) | For app-based installation access       |
| `App ID` (optional)      | Used for JWT if going app-install route |
